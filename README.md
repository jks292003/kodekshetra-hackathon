# What is this project?

This repository contains the files used as part of our project for the Kodekshetra hackathon conducted by Think-Digital, SRM. 

The purpose of this project was to develop an ATM surveillance system that detects if a person's identity is obscured. The system will determine if a person is wearing a helmet or any other item that obscures their face, and lock the ATM facility until it is removed. The goal is to enhance ATM transaction security, prevent fraudulent activity and ensure that the user is identifiable before granting access to the machine. The system should be accurate, reliable, and able to operate in various lighting conditions and angles.

Frameworks and tools used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Streamlit
- Blynk.io
- Smtplib, email
- Haar Cascade (cascade classifier)
